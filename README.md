# radix-staking

I'm a member of the Radix community and I operate, with my friend, a number of nodes on mainnet and Stokenet as part of www.radup.io

I've been part of the Radix node-running community from day one, running nodes initially on betanet. I made the decision early to focus on using the Docker method. I had previous experience with Docker and wanted to be able to leverage that with Radix.

This repo is a community resource intended to document and share my methodology and approach.
